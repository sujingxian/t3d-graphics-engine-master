	 * A GameObject's location is defined by the attached Transform.  
	 * The behaviour of a GameObject is customised by adding one or more Component's.  
	 * Special Component's such as Light's, Camera's and Material's, should be added using the appropriate method.
	 * 
	 * \note A common mistake is to not add the attached Transform component to the root of the scene graph. See T3DTest for an example.
	 * \note The order which Components are updated is based on the order they are added / deleted - beware of issues with multiple Transform-modifying components!
